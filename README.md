# Course Shift Manager (IPM Project)

A human-centered interface for university shift management, developed using Nielsen's heuristics and HCD methodologies.

## 🎯 Core Focus
- **Usability-First Design**: Applied Nielsen's 10 heuristics throughout prototyping (Figma) and implementation (Vue 3)
- **User-Centric Workflows**: Designed for two key personas:
  - Course directors (complex management tasks)
  - Students (self-service requests)
- **Iterative Testing**: Conducted usability evaluations at each phase

## 💡 Key Features
- **Visual Conflict Detection**: Clear highlight of scheduling overlaps
- **Priority Management**: Special status handling with minimal clicks
- **Consistent UI**: Standardized components (Vuetify) following design guidelines

## 🛠️ Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 (Composition API)
- **Prototyping**: Figma
- **Backend**: json-server mock API
